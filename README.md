# Cookbook Version 3.0

***

Welcome to Cookbook Version 3.0! This is my third attempt at recreating Cookbook, our capstone project for Pursuit. I really just wanted to build something to improve my own coding skills and manage a project through its entire lifecycle. As my own knowledge has expanded, I have taken different approaches and used different tech to better improve on the original.

## About

Cookbook is a web (and soon to be mobile) app for posting and sharing recipes. The motivation was to encourage users to get creative with recipes and share their different spins on their friends recipes.
